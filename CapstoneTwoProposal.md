1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use
React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in
becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this
project.
Javascript/React, Node/Express, PostgreSQL.

2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
I want to focus more on the Front-End of this development to push my skills on React.

3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
This website is going to be an e-commerce website built for the web and mobile.

4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
It is designed to show my skills to companies that I am capable of creating a full stack application. 

5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
People who are willing to buy the mock products that I offer. 

6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create
your own API.
I will use a payment API like, Square, Paypal, Blockchain. Anything up to date to stay ahead.

7. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:

a. What does your database schema look like?
Since this is going to be more focused on front end, the schema is going to be simple; User and Products
b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially
important if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces
notoriously messy data.
Security on payments is very important to keep an eye on.

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
User login and user payment information is important.

d. What functionality will your app include?
Authenication, purchasing multiple products, reviewing products?

e. What will the user flow look like?
Create account, logging in, browse through products, add to cart, purchase.

f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your
stretch goals? 
Being able to purchase a product. Stretch goals are to be able to sell a product and have returning customers. 
This to me shows a lot of capabilities to companies not only to the software development side, but business as well.
